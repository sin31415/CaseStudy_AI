# Case Study AI
A case study on AudioStack.


## _Overview and Origin_

* _Name_: [AudioStack](https://audiostack.ai/)

* _Incorporated:_ Nov 03, 2019

* _Founders:_ Timo P Kunz, Peadar Coyle

* _Idea:_ Timo said, " knew that there had to be this magic moment when voices would sound so good, you could finally produce nice things to listen to. Then in 2018, AI architecture made a huge step change and, all of a sudden, voices sounded beautiful and very lifelike. So I quit my job and started AudioStack."

* _Funding:_ Initially from friends and family. Recently secured £3.1M from Quadri Ventures

## Business Activities

* _What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?_

    >Proposinig quick turn around for audio ad creating, in the matter of minutes have production ready, shippable audio ads.

* _Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_
  
    >Intended customers form a massive market as audio ads are for anyone and everyone. The company works with major businesses, ad agencies, publishers, and global brands to generate audio. They have a huge list of signed partners who deal directly with the development team to form audio advertisment solutions that partner with an advertising agency to provide data. The ads are curated by their ad system AdStack which provides the personal curated text for AudioStack.

* _What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_
  
    >The solution they provide is supplying personalized audio advertisments to each and every one of their client's end user in record time. Creating advertisments takes time which then need to go through testing process and closed group analysis, however with their product the advertisment creation time can be reduced significatly allowing ad creation funds to be utilized for ad testing and placement. Synthetic voices never sounded good, they solved the issue by training over large voice audio data to improve voice quality.

* _Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_
    
    >They are using generative AI models and build multimodal stacks that clients can interact with using their propreitary AudioStack API. Less is know about their exact AI models however, mostly using Transformers for their NLP aspect. Since they provide text-to-speech and speech-to-speech services using their AI models, it is safe to assume they use Transformers with attention for speech context parsing and some sort of RNN for speech generation using their voice models.

## Landscape

* _What field is the company in?_

    >The company is primarily in Research and Development, however since the launch of their product they also are now a part of Operations and Creative Production fields.

* _What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?_
    
    >There has many huge strides in this industry over the last 10 years, including the release of a product called ChatGPT by the company OpenAI which has brough AI to the forefront of technological advancements for all of the world. Currently, all major technology companies are shifting their focus to developing more artificial intelligence technologies for general and niche uses. For instance, Google has implemented a search engine enhancement that allows their AI model to directly find the most relevant answer to your question. OpenAI released GPT-4o which now also does audio processing over their LLM enabling increase of technological support for industry sectors like customer service.

* _What are the other major companies in this field?_

    >Other companies in this field are StabilityAI, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta to name a few. More companies are established every day that solve increasingly difficult problems with AI solutions.

## Results

* _What has been the business impact of this company so far?_

    >Since they have partenered with bigger conglomerates like Deloitte, Publicis Group, their audio advertisments have impacted their end users and brought increased engagement. Since the company is relatively new and their AdStack products are newer, impact in terms of revenue has not been disclosed.

* _What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?_

    >AudioStack measures their AdStack performance through multiple metrics like impressions, completion rate, clicks and ctr and cost per reach.

* _How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?_

    >Considering the numerous of funding and their growth in the last few years, the company is performing well. Successfully receiving over 6 million in funding for Series-A they are growing at a rapid pace. Partnering with AWS for cloud computing and increasing their API interfacing speed, they have been able to obtain more clients and are now progressing towards a higher valuation in the next fiscal year.

## Recommendations

* _If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)_

    >They have a specific division for sound/music production using AI. I would recommend they start a division that does specifically music mixing and mastering to a professional level. This way, the audio production budget can be cut and the client company can bring an artist made audio file for mixing.

* _Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?_

    >This would reduce significant computing requirements for a service that is not the top priority of the company revenue source and by adding the recommended functionality, they can add that service as an extra charge to their main source&dash; AdStack. This could also be provided as a bundled service including an AdStack interaction.

* _What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?_

    >This could be done by repurposing their sound design and creation stack without retraining the models. Use of RNN/CNN has been historically seen to work best for these solutions.

* _Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?_

    >Neural Networks have the capabilities to look at future and past outputs thus increasing the quality of their generated outputs with the appropriate weight distribution. If there were to be any more improvements, it would be redone as Transformers to overcome the training or retraining requirements for their models, it could improve the generation capabilities.
